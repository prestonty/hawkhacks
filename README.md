## Inspiration

We walked into this hackathon planning to make a web application or an AI-based program tailored to one of the sponsors but were slapped in the face by blockchain, a field of study the 3 of us never dabbled our toes into. As a result, we built an education platform targeted towards beginners, breaking down challenging concepts into digestible blocks of info.



## What it does:

As newcomers ourselves, we took inspiration from our struggles in learning blockchain and implemented a solution: BlockBRAIN is a blockchain education platform designed to help build YOUR blockchain knowledge, BLOCK by BLOCK! There are a couple of ways BlockBRAIN does this:

* Gamifying the learning experience by rewarding learners with NFTs (which also helps beginners become more involved in the ecosystem).

* Quizzing the learners through short answer questions that are graded by artificial intelligence, encouraging users to absorb technical jargon in their own words.

* Rewarding successful learners with original NFTs from HawkHack's baby hawks!



## How We Built It:

BlockBRAIN was built with a variety of tools, including MongoDB, Express, and Node for managing user data, Cohere’s AI for interpreting the correctness of user-inputted answers, React, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, and Figma for the front end, and PropelAuth for the login system. We also used Mintbase to create very goofy NFTs which serve as our platform's rewards.



## Challenges We Ran Into:

We ran into several challenges throughout the project, the most notably being:

* Configuring Propelauth to work with our MongoDB database.

* Integrating Cohere’s AI and prompt engineering for shorter analysis times.



## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of:

We are proud of being able to develop a project that features is truly full stack with a well-built database! Additionally, we also pushed ourselves outside of our comfort zone in many ways, including drafting our designs in Figma for a curated user experience and exploring the world of blockchain (which was a first for us!).



## What We Learned:

In addition to learning about the blockchain, we also learned:

* Various tools to improve our website design (e.g. Chakra UI)

* Working in a team and learning how to divide our tasks (e.g. splitting front end and back end and using Live Share to collaborate).

* There was in fact, no milk at the fire noodles challenge.

* The power of friendship!! #we thug it out



## What's Next?

Ideally, BrainBLOCK will be expanded in the following ways:
* More lesson plans
* More variety in question types (e.g. multiple choice, multi-select)
* More statistics (e.g. daily streaks, points, leaderboards)
* Introducing an in-game currency and allowing users to create transactions between each other.
